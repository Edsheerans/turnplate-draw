# turnplate-draw

## Introduction

A turnplate-draw by HTML, CSS, JS, and without using picture or canvas.

This project is to make a turnplate for lucky draw.

## Usage

my goal is that you can simplely using it as can as posible. **like:**

```javascript
listOfItem = [
    itemName: probability,
    ...
];

config = {
    bgColor: [...],
    count: 10;// 转盘块数
    ...
}

new turnplate({
    listOfItem,
    config
});

```

## Future
Maybe, I will implement it on `vue.js`.
